*Go report card has no idea how to handle Go 1.18.* ðŸ˜€

* [Types Map](types)
* [QStack](qstack)
* [Rooted Node Tree](tree)
* [Text Sets](set/text/set)

All structures make judicious use of generics and implement the same
json.AsJSON interface (and others) making them much more consumable and
shareable.

## Design Decisions

* **Why no linked-list or queue?** Because they are fulfilled by QStack
  and Node.

* **Decided to drop async walks of Node.** It's easily accomplished by
  enclosing whatever channel is needed in the iterator function and
  forking a goroutine off from within it.

* **Don't stutter.** `tree.Tree` was changed to `tree.E` and
  `qstack.QStack` was changed to `qstack.QS` to follow the idiomatic
  "don't stutter" design preferred by core Go libraries like
  `testing.T`. (We don't want to be another `context.Context`.) 

## TODO

* Add equivalent methods to Node from JavaScript (InsertAfter, etc.)
* Add Union and other set methods
